# Step 1: Prepare the training data
# Assume you have a dataset of salsa dance moves where each sample is represented by a feature vector
# The feature vector could include attributes such as body movement, footwork, arm positions, etc.
# X_train represents the feature vectors, and y_train represents the corresponding salsa dance move labels

# Load the salsa dance moves dataset and split it into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Train the model
# Use a Random Forest Classifier as an example machine learning model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 3: Predict salsa dance moves
# Assuming you have a new feature vector representing a salsa dance move you want to predict
new_move = [0.5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9]  # Example feature vector
predicted_move = model.predict([new_move])

# Step 4: Evaluate the model
# Assuming you have a separate test set (X_test and y_test)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted salsa dance move:", predicted_move)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
